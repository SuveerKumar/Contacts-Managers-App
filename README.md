Contacts-Managers-App
=====================

  This is a simple Contacts Managers Web Application which is built using Angular.JS and Bootstrap. All the styling is done using the powerful Twitter Bootstrap and no other CSS styling is used. This small application elicits the power of Angular.JS and Bootstrap and therefore can be used as an exercise for beginner learning. The server side APIs have been created using Node.JS Express. And the user data is stored on a MongoDB. As you can see the application falls under the MEAN tech-stack. :)

  To run this App, please follow the below steps:

    1) Install Node.js from the official Node.js website.

    2) Install a simple monitor script for use during development of this node.js app. 
        Open up terminal and run the following commands: $ npm install nodemon

    3) Now run the following command to install all the packages: $ npm install

    4) Start nodemon and you are good to go: $ nodemon server.js

    5) Hit the following URL to start the Contacts Managers App: http://localhost:8080/
