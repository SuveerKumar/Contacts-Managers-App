Contacts-Manager-App
=====================

  This is a simple Contacts Manager Web Application which is built using Angular.JS and Bootstrap. All the styling is done using the powerful Twitter Bootstrap and no other CSS styling is used. This small application elicits the power of Angular.JS and Bootstrap and therefore can be used as an exercise for beginner learning. The server side APIs have been created using Node.JS Express. And the user data is stored on a MongoDB. As you can see the application falls under the MEAN tech-stack. :)
