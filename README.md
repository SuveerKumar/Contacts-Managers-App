Contacts-Managers-App
=====================

  This is a simple Contacts Managers Web Application which is built using Angular.JS and Bootstrap. All the styling is done using the powerful Twitter Bootstrap and no other CSS styling is used. This small application elicits the power of Angular.JS and Bootstrap and therefore can be used as an exercise for beginner learning. The server side APIs have been created using Node.JS Express. And the user data is stored on a MongoDB. As you can see the application falls under the MEAN tech-stack. :)

  To run this App, please follow the below steps:

    1) Install Node.js from the official Node.js website.

    3) Open up terminal and run the following commands:
        Command to install all the packages: $ npm install
    
    2) Install a simple monitor script for use during development of this node.js app. 
        Command to install nodemon: $ npm install nodemon

    4) Start nodemon and you are good to go: $ nodemon server.js

    5) Hit the following URL to start the Contacts Managers App: http://localhost:8080/


  If in case you end up getting any errors trying to run the above commands, please feel free to Google those errors and an immediate fix is available at one the forums like Stack Over Flow: http://stackoverflow.com/

  Finally, if you would like to build this application on your own using Angular.JS and Bootstrap.CSS, feel free to do so. It would help you learn a lot in due course.

  Thank you are taking the time to look at this application. :)
